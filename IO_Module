# Learning io operations using io package

import io

#this is a stream of bytes
j = io.BytesIO(b'This is initial data: \x00\x01') 

#.getvalue() reads and give the data in the buffer
#in this example buffer 'j'
print (j.getvalue())

# Ways of writing to buffer 
k = io.StringIO('Hey!!! This is initial Data \n')
print (k.getvalue())
# or use .write method
# note: the data written below would override the initial data
k.write('Written from write method')
print (k.getvalue())

# getvalue and read does the same thing -- fetch the data
# read reads the data from the current position in the buffer
# getvalue reads the data from the starting

# to use read, make sure to reset the position to starting 
# else you may end up reading partial data or blank (if it is already at end)
# note that after writing some data to buffer using write, the cursor position
# would be at the end. so, after write, if you read immediately, you would get blank

# resetting the cursor position to starting
k.seek(0)
print (k.read()) #alternatily can use readline/readlines as well

l = k.read()
print (l)

h = k.getvalue()
print (h)

# closing the buffer
k.close()

# since the buffer is closed here, we will get error upon fetch
print (k.getvalue())
